query 3) is getting a query marker as filter and not a constant,                           fixed
         so constant folding optimization prompt is not triggered
query 4) needs a union query marker so expectation is not matched                          fixed
query 7) is having a distinct query marker so not getting expected match                   fixed
Visitor need to be fixed for date expressions. Currently, date_add is not
        marked as constant                                                                 open
Fix Filter. Right now it this marker is set if there is a Where clause                     
        regardless if there is single table or not. Also, On clause 
        is not checked.                                                                    open
TiDB use case (rewrite through tuner wirth better actual performance)                      fixed
MySQL use case (rewrite through tuner wirth better actual performance)                     fixed
SQL extraction from openAI is clunky and we need a better response back                    open
Current code for costing new SQL only works for single SQL rewrite and
        does not handle multi step rewrite that involves creating temp tables.             open
Improve results that has temp table to use CTE instead. 
        Something like "can you convert the following temp table SQL using
        common table expressions:
        create temptable as select * from t1; select * from temptable A, temptable B;      open
Implement functional verifier.
